- Has an extremely strong plugin exosystem to integrate with other tools and expand its feature set. This is ever evolving so i can only say, that at the time of writing there is a lot.
- Has some support for [[spaced repetition]] via anki as seen here [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqVs1Sw-Ahg&feature=share)
- Very easy to setup, just download install and go.
- Obsidian has a pretty strong following, its got a slick user interface, support for [[Backlinks]]. However its markdown rendering leaves something to be desired in my opinion and the note editing experience while good, is certainly not "great".
- Has support for citations via plugin.
- You can easily build [[Hierarchical Pages]] and explore your notes by looking at them as files within folders.
- If i was to recommend a single editor to someone who is put off by the #Outline style obsidian would be it.
