- The killer feature is that it supports making and then revising [[Spaced Repetition]] cards from any part of your notes. Extremely easy to do and incredibly low friction.
	- [[Logseq]] now also supports this and there is no limit on the number of cards
- This just like [[Roam]] and [[Notion]] uses some proprietary online database, although you can work on it offline. supports markdown export
- Other than that the feature set is very similar to that of [[Roam Research]]. Though a lot less plugins exist for it
- See this for a more detailed comparison between [[Roam]] and remnote [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/gbgtwz/differences_between_roam_research_and_remnote/fpa03pn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
