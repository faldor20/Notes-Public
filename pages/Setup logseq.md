- Syncing
	- To make logseq sync your notes via [[git]] you need to have them stored on github.
		- Create a github account. Create a github repository (make it private if you don't want anyone in the world perusing your notes)
		- Go to logseq and sign in with your github account
		- Copy the url of your github repository(go to it on github then copy it from the address bar, it should look something like this : https://github.com/Eli/Notes)
		- Go to logseq, click the upper right hand corner, click add new graph, paste the link where it says to, type master into the branch name.
		- Click add and install
		- Now whenever you sign in on whatever device, you'll have access to your notes.
		- If that little green dot up in the top right corner turns yellow you are not in sync and you need may need to push or pull changes you have made..
	- If you don't want the hassle of that(If your not in Computer science and/or computer savy you probably don't) just stick the folder in your google/one drive folder and let that deal with syncing it. However if you do it this way you won't be able to access your notes from anywhere any time via logseq. you cans till read them using something like https://stackedit.io/ which supports google drive .
	- You can download logseq onto your device as an application but that does not have automatic git synchronization built in. so either deal with that yourself somehow or use the google drive method
		- if you are on windows there is a program called sparkleshare which syncs git repositories. 
		  If you are on linux you can use that same program or this [script](https://github.com/simonthum/git-sync) with cron or a systmed timer or whatever, as explained in this [blog post](https://worthe-it.co.za/blog/2016-08-13-automated-syncing-with-git.html).
