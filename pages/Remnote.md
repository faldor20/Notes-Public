- The killer feature is that it supports making and then revising [[Spaced Repetition]] cards from any part of your notes. Extremely easy to do and incredibly low friction.
	- [[Logseq]] now also supports this and there is no limit on the number of cards
- This just like [[Roam]] and [[Notion]] uses some proprietary online database, although you can work on it offline. supports markdown export
- Other than that the feature set is very similar to that of [[Roam Research]]. Though a lot less plugins exist for it
- A number of features are only availabe for Pro users. the list can be found here https://remnote.io/p/help/document/RT65yrxk9S8jKrnvTpublish
  One of the most interesting being PDF highlighting and annotation.
	- Currently pro is $6/month or $300 for life
