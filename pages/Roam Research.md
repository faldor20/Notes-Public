alias:: Roam

- Tags #Outline #AutoSync #Web #Paid #ComplexContent #Markup/Markdown
- Uses a proprietary online only database, supports markdown export
- very expensive.
- Strong community.
- best in class editing experience. everything is just "smooth" It's hard to put into words but real care and attention has been paid to making it feel very good to use.
- If i'm honest i struggle to recommend roam when logseq and remnote exist. Those both have essentially the same functionality as far as general use is concerned, plus extras.
